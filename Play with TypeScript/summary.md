# Play with TypeScript

TypeScript :: Programming Language
TypeScript :: TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.

## Why TypeScript?

- Avoid bugs in development
- Increase development speed
- Additional features

## How does it work?

We can not use TypeScript in production. We write TypeScript and then we compile it to convert it into JavaScript format so that we can use it into production. Once the code is compiled the JavaScript file will not change untill we make some changes and then compile it again.

## Installation

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm
$ npm install -g typescript
$ tsc --help
$ tsc --version
```

# Making Layouts changes for Tablet and Phone

- Big Screen & Laptop Range :: 1800px -> 1200px
- Tablet Range :: 1200px -> 600px
- Mobile Range :: -> 600px

Keep in mind that we do not have too much width if we are making a website responsive for Tablets, and Smart phones. So, adjust the content along with device width. To do this we may have to adjust content :-

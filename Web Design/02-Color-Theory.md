# What are Colors?

This is not a Physics class but to understand what color exactly is? We must know the science behind it and this can help in UX Designing. How? Let see.

Colors are the way our eyes and brain perceive different wavelengths of light. Visible light, which is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see, ranges from around 400 to 700 nanometers in wavelength. When light hits an object, some of it is absorbed, and some of it is reflected. The reflected light enters our eyes, where it is detected by cells in the retina called cones. These cones are sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths, corresponding to the colors red, green, and blue.

Different cultures and fields (such as art, design, and science) have various systems for categorizing and working with colors, including the RGB color model (used in digital screens) and the CMYK color model (used in printing).

# Key Takeaways.

Colors start with our eyes. When light hits something, our eyes catch the light that bounces off it. This light is made up of different wavelengths, and our eyes can tell these wavelengths apart. Our brain then takes this information and tells us what color we're seeing.

# Types of Colors

1. Primary Colors (Building blocks for other colors)
   - Red
   - Yellow
   - Blue
2. Secondary Colors (Obtained by equaly mixing Pimary color)
   - Red & Blue
     - Purple
   - Red & Yellow
     - Orange
   - Yellow & Blue
     - Green
3. Tertiary Colors (Obtained by mixing Primary and Secondary colors)

# Color Terminologies.

- Hue :- Purest color in the family (High intensity color in the family)
- Tint :- Mixing white color with a specific color, the resultent color will be called as a Tint.
- Shade :- Mixing black color with a specific color, the resultent color will be called as a Shade. It is like a darker version of Hue.
- Tone :- Mixing a pure color with a gray color.
  - Gray :- Equal mixing of white and black color.
- Saturation :- Saturation is basically refers to how rich or dull a color is.
- Brightness :- It tells us whether a color is closer to black or closer to white on the scale.
- Color Temperature :- It tells us whether a color is warm or cold.
  - Cold Colors Area :: Blue, Green, Purple, Violet, Explore the area.
  - Warm Colors Area :: Yellow, Orange, Red, Explore the area.

# Color Models

1. Subtractive Mixing (CMYK)

   - Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black
   - This model is used for Printing.

2. RGB

   - Red, Green, & Blue
   - Additive mixing of light to create different colors.

3. HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness)
4. HSL
5. CSS
6. HEX (Widely used color format.)

# Color Harmonies.

Let say we picked up a primary color for our project but the question is how do we know which colors work well with that primary? How do we create a color palette for our project.

1. Copy the HEX code value of the color that we want to choose as a primary color.
2. Go to the website. [Click Here](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
3. Paste the HEX code value on the base position in the color wheel.
4. Play with Color Harmony and choose the right color for your website to desing it.
5. To make things simple, choose any one harmony because it is widely used.

   - Analogous
   - Monochromatic

# Typography

Typography is the most important part of any design because the majority of content is usually text. So, if we are not using the right typeface, font-size, line-heigh, font-weight, and so on it will impact on UX.

Typography starts from choosing a font-type or font-family for our website. Let choose a font from one of these most popular font wesbites.

- [Google Fonts](https://www.fonts.google.com) -> Free to use.
- [Adobe Fonts](https://www.fonts.adobe.com) -> Paid Service.

<code>Readability should be heigher. Using more fonts in our website may impact on website performance.</code>

# Font Attributes and Roles

After choosing the font we need to decide what should be the attribute and its roles are going to be. It means which font we should use in Headings, for a normal paragraphs, for buttons, and so on.

Attributes mean -> Letter-spacing, Font-Size, weight, line-height, .......so on.

<code>Single Typefaces -> All the elements will be using fonts from the family so settings role is easy.</code>
<code>Multiple Typefaces -> Trickier. Use the font with the best readability for smaller elements.</code>

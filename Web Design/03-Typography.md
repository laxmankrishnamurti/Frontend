# Typography

Typography is the most important part of any design because the majority of content is usually text. So, if we are not using the right typeface, font-size, line-heigh, font-weight, and so on it will impact on UX.

Typography starts from choosing a font-type or font-family for our website. Let choose a font from one of these most popular font wesbites.

- [Google Fonts](https://www.fonts.google.com) -> Free to use.
- [Adobe Fonts](https://www.fonts.adobe.com) -> Paid Service.

<code>Readability should be heigher. Using more fonts in our website may impact on website performance.</code>

<code>Modern fonts -> san serif</code>

# Font Attributes and Roles

After choosing the font we need to decide what should be the attribute and its roles are going to be. It means which font we should use in Headings, for a normal paragraphs, for buttons, and so on.

Attributes mean -> Letter-spacing, Font-Size, weight, line-height, .......so on.

<code>Single Typefaces -> All the elements will be using fonts from the family so settings role is easy.</code>
<code>Multiple Typefaces -> Trickier. Use the font with the best readability for smaller elements.</code>

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. To properly define the typography of our project, there are a few steps we need to follow.

   - First, decide where we want to get our fonts from.
   - Then, decide which fonts would work best for the brand and audience, based on the message we want our website to convey.
   - Fonts should also be picked using criteria like readability and loading time.

2. After picked our fonts, we need to set proper roles and attributes.

3. Start Typography process by defining the "type scale", "font weight", and "Line-height".

4. Use tools like <code>Type Scale</code> <code>ArcheType</code> to make this task easier.

5. If our design app allows it, create text styles for elements like heading and paragraphs.

# Spacing and Sizing in Web Design

This referes to how much space we should use inside and outside of an elements and also how big and small they should be.

<code>Eight point system -> Every dimension is basically a multiple of 8. -> For Simplicity and Consistency (Create your own custom system)</code>

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. Spacinig and sizing are very important in UI design because they will dictate the amount of whitespace and also the visual hierarchy.

2. For Spacing and Sizing elements, use the 8pt system where every margin, padding, widht, etc. is a multiple of 8.

3. Grids are not always necessary and can sometimes add an unwanted degree of complexity to a project.

4. Using guides is a perfect fine replacement for grids.

# Icons and Images in Web Design.

## Icons

1. Icon should be meaningful. The icon should visually represent what the associated text is saying. The icon and text work together to tell a story.

2. Icon sytle should be consistence.

- [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com)
- [Font awesom](https://fontawesome.com)
- [Hero icons](https://heroicons.com)
- [Ion Icons](https://ionic.io/ionicons)
- [Forge Icons](https://icons.theforgesmith.com)
- [Icon set](https://iconset.io)

3. Pair the icons with text.

## Images

Try to use the real pictures on your website instead of using any random pictures to be genuine.

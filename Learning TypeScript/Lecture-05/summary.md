## number & boolean

- Type Inference :: Actually, we don't need to write variable type number, boolean again & again if we are initialize it's value on declaration time. TypeScript is enough smart to detected the type of the variable, doing this can be overwhelming.

- The syntax of colon boolean, number is a TypeScript syntax so whenever a JavaScript compiled file is going to come in it's never going to be a colon or the value.

- To be more precise, we shouldn't be doing too much obviouos thing, yes there is a special place where we can use it, but not everywhere.

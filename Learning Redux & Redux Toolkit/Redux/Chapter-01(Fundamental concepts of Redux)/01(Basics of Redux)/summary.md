# KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. We create a store and pass reference of the reducer.
2. In reducer we define all functionality and behaviour to manipulate the state value based on action type.
3. Before dispatching anything action we must have to define all action creators that is nothing but the type of action that we actually want to perform in reducer.
4. Store dispatches action type.
5. Subscribe is a method of store object that runs every single time whenever a new dispatch come in.

# State Management in react?

- React Provides a basic level of state management feature. They are :-

  - Context API
  - Context API with useReducer

- Managing state for complex/big scale application by using React's way is become difficult. So, therefor we use state management library to manage state in React. There are multiple state management library, for example :- Redux, Redux-Toolkit, Zustand....etc.

But, I'm going to use the Redux and it's extended version which is Redux-Toolkit.

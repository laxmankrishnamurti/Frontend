### Error : To https://github.com/laxmankrishnamurti/Frontend.git

! [rejected] main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/laxmankrishnamurti/Frontend.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

# Solution

- Step 01: Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

```javascript
git fetch origin
```

- Step 02: Merge the remote changes into your local branch:

```javascript
git merge origin/main
```

- Alternatively, you can use git pull to fetch and merge in one step:

```javascript
git pull origin main
```

- Step 03: Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur. If there are conflicts, Git will show you which files have conflicts. You will need to open those files, resolve the conflicts, and then commit the changes.

- Step 04: Push your changes to the remote repository

```javascript
git push origin main
```

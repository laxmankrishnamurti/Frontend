## Assignment

This is continuation of previous assignment RESUME Builder. Now you have to make a separate component ResumeEditor which has a FORM. This form will have many input boxes. Each one related to one section. For example you can have one input box or experience section. Another input box for skill section and like this. Every input box should have an Add button in front of it. Once you press this add button that information is stored in the state , which you can update at top of the App level. Now this state should update the Resume Component and its child you have built.

- first component will be your RESUME document which is only for reading purpose.

- second component will be this FORM

- you have to manage the state in between

- only Add functionality is required in this assignment

- you can change input boxes according to your need depending on your format of Resume. You can have multiple textboxes also for same section. Like for date + experience item etc.

Note :: To be more precise i have to add CRUD Functionality into the resume. That's it.

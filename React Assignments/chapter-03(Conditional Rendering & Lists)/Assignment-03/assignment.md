## This is continuation of previous assignment RESUME Builder

(1). In this part you have to make some conditional rendering. Suppose if any section doesn't exist you have to remove that section from Resume. Example if skills is empty array than don't display skills section in Resume.

## You have to use map in most places where there are arrays. Like Skills, Education, Experience if there are 3 entries, use map to display 3 experience items. You don't need fix number of items. Any array can have 1 to 10(or some Limit) any number of items. You can put some Limit, so that your layout is not affected.
